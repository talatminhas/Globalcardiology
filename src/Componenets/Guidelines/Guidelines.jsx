                                        Peer review is applied to all research articles and the majority of other article types published in Global Cardiology. This usually entails at least two independent, expert peer reviewers.</p>

                                    <h5 className="fs-6 fw-bold pt-3">Policy</h5>
                                    <p className="fw-light">
                                        All submissions to <b className="fw-medium">Global Cardiology </b> are first checked for completeness (criteria for desk reject are available in the <b className="text-danger">Guide for Authors</b>) before being sent to an Editor, who decides whether they are suitable for peer review. If an Editor is on the author list or has a competing interest in a particular manuscript, another member of the Editorial Board will be assigned to oversee peer review. When making a decision, Editors will consider the peer-reviewed reports, but they will not be bound by the opinions or recommendations contained in them. A single peer reviewer's or the Editor's concern may result in the manuscript being rejected. Peer review reports are sent to authors along with the editorial decision on their manuscript.

                                        At <b className="fw-medium">Global Cardiology</b> papers undergo a <a className="text-black fw-medium" href="/">single-blind review process </a> - meaning that the reviewersâ€™ identity is not shared with the authors.
                                    </p>

                                    <p className="fw-light">
                                        Peer reviewer selection is critical to the publication process. A variety of factors influence it, including expertise, reputation, specific recommendations, conflicts of interest, and previous performance. All of these qualities are highly desirable: speed, thoroughness, sound reasoning, and collegiality.

                                        Before accepting an invitation to review a manuscript, potential peer reviewers should notify the Editor of any potential conflicts of interest. Editors' and peer reviewers' communications contain confidential information that should not be shared with third parties.

                                        <b>Global Cardiology</b> is committed to making editorial decisions and publishing them as soon as possible, and we believe that an efficient editorial process benefits both our authors and the research community as a whole. As a result, we ask reviewers to respond within the agreed-upon time frame. If reviewers anticipate a delay, we ask that they notify us so that we can keep the authors updated and, if necessary, find alternative solutions.

                                        <b>Global Cardiology</b> is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and strives for demographic diversity among peer reviewers. When inviting peer reviewers, editors are bly encouraged to consider geographical regions, gender identities, racial/ethnic groups, and other groups.

                                        False or misleading information, such as identity theft and suggesting fake peer-reviewers, will result in the manuscript being rejected, further investigation in accordance with PAGEPress' misconduct policy <a className="hover-text-underline text-decoration-none" href=""><b className="text-danger hover-text-underine">(https://www.pagepress.org/site/plagiarism_misconduct) </b></a>, and notification to the authors' institutions/employers.

                                        The primary goal of peer review is to provide the Editor with the information needed to make a fair, evidence-based decision that adheres to the journal's editorial criteria. Review reports should also assist authors in revising their paper so that it can be accepted for publication. Reports that include a recommendation to reject the paper should explain the major flaws in the research; this will help the authors prepare their manuscript for possible re-submission (if allowed by the Editor) or submission to a different journal.

                                        <p className="fw-medium pt-3">Before submitting a report, reviewers should ask themselves the following questions:</p>
